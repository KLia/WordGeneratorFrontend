      <p class="section-description">
          The <span class="special-text">Word Generator</span> is built using a model called Markov Chains - a piece of software that utilizes statistics to determine 
          what letters might occur next to each. The code was extended and built upon an open-source project called <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">Markovify</a>.

        You can specify the following settings to generate new words:

    <div class="section-description">
        <div class="quote left">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Corpus</span> - The original text. Words must be separated by spaces or new lines. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">State Size</span> - Grouping size to determine the next probability</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Minimum word length</span> - All generated words should be at least this many letters long. 
                    Sometimes it is impossible to generate words that are long enough if the state size is too big. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Number of words</span> - The number of words that the program returns back as a result</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="section-description">
        There are two components needed to generate new words - <span class='italic'>corpus</span> and <span class='italic'>state size</span>. 
        The <span class='italic'>corpus</span> is a list of words that the software will break down into letters and extract statistical information from.  
        The <span class='italic'>state size</span> is the number of consecutive letters that are grouped together, and from which the next probable letter is determined.
        The best default value for this is generally 2, but you can play around with the slider to get different results.
    </div>

    <div class="section-description">
        Let's take the following corpus as an example, with a state size of 2.
        
    </div>

    <div class="section-description">
        <div class="quote code">
            <ul>

                <li>bar </li>
                <li>bra </li>
                <li>cab </li>

                <li>car </li>
                <li>carb </li>
                <li>crab </li>
                <li>scars </li>

    <div class="section-description">
        The program must now determine a starting letter. The words in the corpus start either with an <span class='italic'>a</span>,
        <span class='italic'>b</span>, <span class='italic'>c</span> or <span class='italic'>s</span>. The probabilities of choosing a starting letter are:

    <div class="section-description">
        Let's assume it picks the letter with the highest probability - <span class='italic'>c</span>. Now it needs to choose the next letter, which can either
        be an <span class='italic'>a</span> or an <span class='italic'>r</span>. The probability of picking the next letter is:

    <div class="section-description">
        Let's assume again that it picks the letter with the highest probability - <span class='italic'>a</span>. So far, the program has build the word 
        <span class='special-text'>ca</span>. The length of the word is two letters long, which matches our <span class='italic'>state size</span>. Therefore,
        from now on, all probabilities need to include the previous 2 letters. The words in the corpus that match our current <span class='italic'>state</span>
        are <span class='italic'><span class='special-text'>ca</span>b</span>, 
        <span class='italic'><span class='special-text'>ca</span>bs</span>, 
        <span class='italic'><span class='special-text'>ca</span>r</span>,

        Again, we assume it picks the letter with the highest probability - <span class='italic'>r</span>. The word so far is <span class='special-text'>car</span>,

        that our current state is <span class='special-text'>ar</span>, and the words that match that are
